                    taking the time to address outstanding issues and expected timelines, we were able to create a
                    buffer that allowed us to meet the business demands of simultaneously overhauling the user
                    experiences of multiple SaaS products while continuing to add value to their legacy versions.</p>

                    several redesigns that had not been fully implemented and the source code to the native mobile apps
                    had been lost. The Engineering team recommended building a Progressive Web App (PWA) to replace the
                    mobile apps, leverage the team's expertise, and have a shared codebase for both mobile platforms.
                    This would also allow us to refactor the web application at the feature level without negatively
                    impacting the experience for clients.</p>

                    ability to add, curate, and moderate multiple social media sources into a single feed known as a
                    'vertical'. The app achieved this by recreating the layouts and populating the content with cached
                    copies of the original social media posts from platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, and
                    Facebook. All of the modules needed to be upyated and redesigned to add responsiveness, pass WCAG
                    2.1 accessibility guidelines, and match the latest UIs of the social media platforms. Custom modules
                    for video and editorial content were also designed and developed to fulfill requests from the
                    company's media clients.</p>
