                    network competing with Netflix, HBO and Showtime. In an attempt to keep up with their rivals, Starz
                    had previously launched streaming apps but struggled with activations and growth. It was clear they
                    needed a fresh perspective and business model, one that would resonate with consumers by catering to
                    diverse lifestyles and needs.</p>

                    build, and deploy 3 versions of the app in near simultaneous launch windows. The end to end design
                    was alloted 3 months to produce Roku, Amazon FireTV and Samsung SmartTVs experiences which were all
                    new platforms for the Digiflare team.</p>
                <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-normal has-text-grey-light">The components allowed us to work at a
                    high fidelity and sped up the production of consistent, accurate layouts. Since measurements were
                    baked in, it also facilitated a quick turn-around time for creating production-ready UI elements.

                    hand-off was a new concept at the time, but we took a calculated risk to get ahead of the deadlines
                    by adding Zeplin.io to our design stack. This saved multiple sprints worth of time by automating
                    measurement specifications and removed what would have been a costly bottleneck for development. The
                    remaining time was used to create reusable components, add quality of life enhancements and
                    personalization elements.</p>
